# olympus-camera-control

Olympus camera control is a python based programm with a QT5 Gui. The program allows you to control your camera over a wifi connection. Life view and other features are also available.
Since I sold my olympus camera I won't continue this project. Feel free to take the provided code and modify as you wish. I think specially the olylivede might be intresting, which includes quite a lot of reverse engeneering and also the class liveStreamThread where the UDP stream is initialized.
